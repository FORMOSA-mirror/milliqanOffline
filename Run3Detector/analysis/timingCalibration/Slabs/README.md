This directory holds the various scripts used to do a base calibration of the timing systems for the slab detector.

# These scripts are intended to be used to analyze detector properties and determine cuts for finding quality pulses likely from beam and cosmic muons, and then apply these selections to the timing difference. 

The time difference between the two slabs should correspond to the physical length of the detector roughly divided by the speed of light. However because of cable lengths this requires some maneuvering. 

# A Beam muon registers a traversal time of ($t_2$ + $l_2$)-($t_2$+$l_1$) and a Cosmic muon registers -[($t'_2$ + $l'_2$)-($t'_2$+$l'_1$)] since cosmics typically arrive from above the cavern
